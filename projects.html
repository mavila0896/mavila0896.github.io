                    Simplified MTA Application
                    <p class="project-info">This was a project that was done in my Software Engineering class back in Fall 2018. The project was to create a GUI (application) that would serve its purpose for people that do not know how to use web or for people with disability.
                        We were given a specifi URL and had to create offline queries, user accounts (inlcuding admin), storage on where the search or users would be stored in, and more. </p>

                    Class Website
                    <p class="project-info">This was my first website ever created. This was done in my CS355 (Internet and Web Technology Class) in Summer 2018. There were 4 assignments done in class. The Project is to revise the entire design and make it better to show. The
                        original website can be found <a href="https://venus.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~avma9035/">here</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>NOTE: The APIs from the original website no longer work due to permissions for publishing being removed after the class ended.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The assignments done in class is by the following:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assignment 0/1: Create a public_html and have the server running, making your website accessible in public using venus.</li>
                        <li>Assignment 2: Creating a Server connection message using PHP. We have 2 buttons which shows both my side and the professors side of connection. It will show a message with the user input that you have been connected to the server
                            you entered to.
                        </li>
                        <li>Assignment 3: URL Parser. It will take the URL address in pieces sorting them from domain, subdomain, host, path, and IP Address.</li>
                        <li>Assignment 4: We create a grid or table that will display and show 5 API's (We were allowed to copy and paste the code when given permission to access to) It has to show the real time counter for it to work on the website.</li>
                    </ul>
